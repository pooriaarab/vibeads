# vibeads Demo Video - Design Doc

## Concept: "The Dead Space"

**Duration:** ~30 seconds
**Audience:** a16z partners/investors, Twitter/X, GitHub README
**Tone:** Dark, cinematic, provocative. Film trailer energy.
**Core message:** Vibecoding creates dead time. vibeads fills it.

## Tech Stack

- **Remotion** (React-based video framework) for composition
- **ElevenLabs** for voiceover + background music
- **1920x1080, 30fps, MP4 output**

## Storyboard (8 Scenes)

### Scene 1: THE HOOK (0s-3s)
- Black screen, blinking cursor, types: `> claude "build me an app"`
- Audio: Low synth drone fading in. No voice.

### Scene 2: THE WAIT (3s-7s)
- Realistic Claude Code terminal with generic spinner ("Thinking...")
- Slow zoom on the spinner area, dim glow highlight
- VO: "Three million developers vibecode every day. And while they wait..."
- Audio: Drone builds, bass pulse on "wait"

### Scene 3: THE DEAD SPACE (7s-10s)
- Quick cuts: 3 rapid shots of dead moments (spinner, empty status bar, blank session start)
- Each highlighted with pulsing red/orange box
- Large center text: `DEAD TIME`
- VO: "...they stare at dead space."
- Audio: Bass drop, beat of silence

### Scene 4: THE REVEAL (10s-14s)
- Same terminal, now with vibeads. Zoom on spinner: "Add auth in 5 lines with Clerk..."
- Pull back to show status line with Clerk recommendation
- Both glow cyan
- VO: "What if every idle moment became a recommendation?"
- Audio: Synth chord resolves upward

### Scene 5: THE PLACEMENTS (14s-20s)
- Rapid montage, ~1.5s per placement with label overlay:
  1. SPINNER VERBS - PlanetScale ad in spinner
  2. STATUS LINE - Groq ad with clickable link
  3. CONTEXT INJECTION - Claude response with highlighted recommendation
  4. STACK ANALYSIS - Session start output with tech stack gaps
- Sharp cuts with bass hits
- VO: "Contextual. Native. Five placement tiers, woven into the workflow."

### Scene 6: THE SCALE (20s-24s)
- Dark background. Visual metaphors:
  - Grid of tiny circles filling screen (3M developers)
  - 20 colored dots arranged in a cluster (portfolio companies)
  - 5 layered rectangles (placement tiers)
  - Single terminal prompt (one npm install)
- VO: "Twenty portfolio companies. Zero friction. One npm install."

### Scene 7: THE INSTALL (24s-27s)
- Clean terminal. Types: `npm install -g vibeads`
- Output appears: "vibeads - contextual dev tool discovery... Ready!"
- No voiceover. Terminal speaks.
- Audio: Clean satisfying tone

### Scene 8: THE CLOSE (27s-30s)
- Black screen. "vibeads" fades in center
- Subtitle: "ads for the age of vibecoding"
- Small: github.com/pooriaarab/vibeads
- Audio: Final bass note, silence

## Voiceover Script (full)

"Three million developers vibecode every day. And while they wait... they stare at dead space. What if every idle moment became a recommendation? Contextual. Native. Five placement tiers, woven into the workflow. Twenty portfolio companies. Zero friction. One npm install."
